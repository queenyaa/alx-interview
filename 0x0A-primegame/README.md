### Importance of the Task

This task, involving the simulation of a game based on the removal of prime numbers and their multiples, offers several layers of educational and practical significance:

1. **Understanding Prime Numbers**:
   - Prime numbers are fundamental in various fields of mathematics and computer science. This task reinforces the understanding of what prime numbers are and how they can be efficiently identified using algorithms like the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

2. **Algorithm Optimization**:
   - Efficiently identifying prime numbers up to a large limit is a classic problem in computer science. Implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes demonstrates the importance of algorithm optimization and complexity analysis, key components in developing efficient code.

3. **Game Theory**:
   - The task introduces basic principles of game theory, particularly in turn-based games with optimal play strategies. Understanding these principles can be applied to more complex scenarios in economics, artificial intelligence, and competitive programming.

4. **Dynamic Programming and Memoization**:
   - The problem requires storing and reusing results of previously solved subproblems, illustrating the use of dynamic programming and memoization. These techniques are critical for solving complex problems efficiently by avoiding redundant calculations.

5. **Python Programming Skills**:
   - The task involves implementing a solution in Python, reinforcing knowledge of loops, conditional statements, list and set operations, and functions. Adhering to PEP 8 style and writing clean, executable code is also emphasized.

6. **Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking**:
   - Solving this task involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts, developing a strategy for each part, and then combining them into a cohesive solution. This enhances problem-solving and critical thinking skills, which are essential in software development and beyond.

7. **Educational Value**:
   - This task serves as an educational exercise for students and professionals to deepen their understanding of several key computer science concepts. It combines theoretical knowledge with practical implementation, making it a comprehensive learning experience.

8. **Real-World Applications**:
